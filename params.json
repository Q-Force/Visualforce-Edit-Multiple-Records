{"name":"Visualforce Edit Multiple Records","tagline":"Visualforce template and example on how to create a an editable table of records, including adding and deleting.","body":"This project contains a Visualforce template and example on how to create a an editable table of records, including adding and deleting. More specifically, the example involved is creating an editable screen to allow managing of Contact records against an Account.\r\n\r\nThe package does not include a default Account layout that is already customized in an attempt to not override any existing Page Layout. The custom buttons need to be manually added to the Page Layout.\r\n\r\nImplementation Notes\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe code involved breaks down into three main files:\r\n\r\n* EditableList.cls\r\n\r\n  This is an abstract class that controller extensions can implement that defines generic implementation methods for manipulating the table, as well as persisting and deleting records.\r\n  \r\n\r\n* EditableContactListExtension.cls\r\n\r\n  This is a sample implementation class for an Account controller extension. Only the required method overrides are implemented.\r\n  \r\n\r\n* EditableContactList.page\r\n\r\n  Sample Visualforce implementation for managing Contact records against an Account. Allows adding, editing, and removing child records. This file will require modifications to add or remove different fields from the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation Link\r\n----\r\n  \r\n* [https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04ti00000003vvQ](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04ti00000003vvQ)\r\n* **Note**: not guaranteed to be current\r\n* To install to a sandbox environment, change the subdomain from login to test","google":"UA-44976971-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
